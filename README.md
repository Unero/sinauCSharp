# Learning C# Language, Self-Learn.

## About
C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a simple, modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers.

In this repo i learning a few things in C#, there are:
1. Program Stucture  
    *programs, namespaces, types, members, and assemblies*
1. Types and Variables  
    *value types, reference types, and variables*
1. Expressions  
    *operands and operators*
1. Statements  
    Basically *statements*
1. Classes and Objects  
    OOP Way
1. Structs  
    ***Structs*** are data structures that, unlike classes, are value types.
1. Arrays
    An ***array*** is a data structure that contains a number of variables that are accessed through computed indices.
1. Interfaces  
    An ***interface*** defines a contract that can be implemented by classes and structs. An interface can contain methods, properties, events, and indexers. An interface does not provide implementations of the members it definesâ€”it merely specifies the members that must be supplied by classes or structs that implement the interface.
1. Delegates  
    A ***delegate*** type represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type. Delegates make it possible to treat methods as entities that can be assigned to variables and passed as parameters. Delegates are similar to the concept of function pointers found in some other languages, but unlike function pointers, delegates are object-oriented and type-safe.
1. Attributes  
    ***Attributes*** enable programs to specify additional declarative information about types, members, and other entities.

Its contain of basic code that, implement all above topic.
  
## Hello World Example
```chsarp
using System;

class Hello
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World");
    }
}
```
